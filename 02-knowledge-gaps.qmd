# Knowledge Gaps Limiting Robust, Scalable and Credible NbCS for the United States {#sec-knowledge}

## Knowledge gaps related to field data scarcity

Our understanding of the technical mitigation potential of many NbCS strategies is limited by a scarcity of representative field data, either because these data do not yet exist or because they are not yet freely accessible. Notable exceptions exist, including networks of ecosystem-scale flux towers (e.g., AmeriFlux65,66 and NSFâ€™s National Ecological Observatory Network, or NEON67) and the wealth of information on tree biomass and associated stand dynamics supported by the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program68. These networks may provide sufficiently representative data to map carbon fluxes at coarse scales69, or even to estimate potential changes in plant carbon stocks achievable with some NbCS like reforestation70,71. However, networks like NEON, FIA and AmeriFlux were not designed specifically with the goal of evaluating NbCS, and many specific NbCS management strategies (e.g., cover crops, soil amendments, altered forest management, wetland restoration) are potentially un- or under-represented in these networks. These networks were also not designed to be interoperable, which makes it difficult to blend information from disparate networks (e.g., FIA and AmeriFlux) into synthetic analyses and products. Efforts to dynamically catalog existing NbCS field trials and the activities of relevant monitoring networks would permit an informed prioritization of new data collection and facilitate synthesis of new and existing network data.
